    <h2>Walk Score vs Population</h2>

         alt="Walk Score vs Population Graph" width="800">
       <h2>Analysis:
           The scatterplot shows that stations with lower Walk Scores (mainly those above 100th Street and in the Bronx) often house larger populations. These areas appear to be more residential, with more housing and fewer commercial buildings or walkable destinations, resulting in lower Walk Scores in the 58–85 range but populations often above 80,000.
In contrast, stations located in Manhattan especially below 59th Street have some of the highest Walk Scores (97–100) but have much smaller population count (typically 45,000–60,000). These areas are extremely walkable but dominated by commercial districts and colleges rather than residential buildings and housing.</h2>
<h2>Conclusion: There is no strong positive correlation between Walk Score and population size. Highly walkable areas are not necessarily more populated; instead, Building development (residential vs. commercial districts) drive the differences.</h2>

    <h2>Walk Score vs Median Income</h2>

         alt="Walk Score vs Median Income Graph" width="800">
    <h2> Analysis:
        This graph reveals a clearer pattern. Stations with Walk Scores above 95 (located in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, as well as the Lower East Side) show very high median incomes, often between $110,000 and $160,000. Walkability in these neighborhoods correlates with high-income resdients and strong commercial infrastructure.
By contrast, stations in the Bronx all of which have Walk Scores between 58 and 88 show much lower median incomes, typically between $42,000 and $55,000. These areas are less walkable due to wider roads, fewer commercial buildings, and more vehicle depedent infrastructure that may be more convinent for residents in those loctions.</h2>
    </h2>    Conclusion: There is a moderate positive correlation between Walk Score and median income. Wealthier neighborhoods tend to be more walkable, likely due to urban design investments, denser commercial development, and demand for pedestrian-friendly environments rather then vehicle depedent infrastructure.</h2>

    <h2>ZIP Code vs Walk Score</h2>
    <img src="images/zipvswalkscore.png?v=1"
         alt="ZIP Code vs Walk Score Graph" width="800">
    <h2> Analysis:
        This plot shows an even clearer distinction between Manhattan and Bronx ZIP codes. Manhattan ZIPs (100xx) have a very high average walk score between 97 and 100, Which showcases that the borough is uniformly walkable across its commercial and residential districts.
Bronx ZIP codes (104xx), however, show much more varity, with Walk Scores between 58 and 96. Areas like Parkchester and Soundview reach up into the 95–96 range, but others such as Westchester Sq.–E Tremont Ave drop below 60.
However because ZIP codes reflect geography more than socioeconomic grouping, the graph does not show a strong relationship but it highlights that walkability widely varies between boroughs rather than within them.
   </h2> Conclusion: ZIP code alone does not predict Walk Score well, but it does highlight the major borough-level divide: Manhattan is consistently walkable, while the Bronx varies widely across neighborhoods.</h2>
