        <p>
            A detailed data analysis of the neighborhoods surrounding NYC 6 Train stations,

    <!-- Walk Score vs Population -->
    <section>
        <h2>Walk Score vs Population</h2>

             alt="Walk Score vs Population Graph">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
        The scatterplot shows that stations with lower Walk Scores (mainly those above 100th Street 
        and in the Bronx) often serve larger nearby populations. These neighborhoods 
        are more residential with fewer commercial corridors, producing Walk Scores in the 58–85 range 
        but populations often above 80,000.  
        In contrast, stations in Manhattan — especially below 59th Street — have extremely high 
        Walk Scores (97–100) but smaller local populations (45,000–60,000), reflecting dense commercial 
        land use and campus zones rather than residential blocks.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
        There is no strong positive correlation between Walk Score and population size. 
        Walkable areas are not necessarily more populated; differences appear driven more by 
        land use (commercial vs. residential development).

        <h2>Walk Score vs Median Income</h2>
        <img src="images/walkscorevincomegraph.png?v=1" width="800"
             alt="Walk Score vs Median Income Graph">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
        Stations with Walk Scores above 95 — primarily in Midtown, Downtown Manhattan, and the 
        Lower East Side — show very high median incomes ($110,000–$160,000). Walkability in these 
        districts corresponds with high-income residents and dense commercial infrastructure.  
        By contrast, Bronx stations with Walk Scores between 58 and 88 have much lower median 
        incomes ($42,000–$55,000). These neighborhoods tend to have wider roadways, fewer businesses, 
        and more vehicle-dependent infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
        There is a moderate positive correlation between Walk Score and median income. 
        Wealthier neighborhoods tend to be more walkable, likely reflecting investments in 
        urban design, public transit, and commercial density.

    <!-- ZIP vs Walk Score -->
    <section>
        <h2>ZIP Code vs Walk Score</h2>
        <img src="images/zipvswalkscore.png?v=1" width="800"
             alt="ZIP Code vs Walk Score Graph">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
        Manhattan ZIP codes (100xx) consistently show Walk Scores between 97 and 100, 
        reflecting extremely walkable environments across both residential and commercial areas.  
        Bronx ZIP codes (104xx) vary widely from 58 to 96, indicating a more mixed urban layout 
        with differences in density, retail access, and street design.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
        ZIP code alone does not strongly predict Walk Score, but it highlights a clear borough-level 
        divide: Manhattan is uniformly walkable, while the Bronx varies significantly by neighborhood.
