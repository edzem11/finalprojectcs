        <p>
            A detailed data analysis of the neighborhoods surrounding NYC 6 Train stations, 
            including graphs that compare economic and geographic relationships.

        <h2>Walk Score vs Nicche</h2>

             alt="Walk Score vs Niche">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
        Neighborhoods with strong Niche rankings consistently have very high Walk Scores (typically above 95). Lower-ranked neighborhoods show more variation in walkability, though most still remain relatively walkable due to New York City’s dense urban layout.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
      There is a clear association between walkability and neighborhood ranking. Neighborhoods that are easier to navigate on foot tend to score better on Niche’s livability scale, highlighting the importance of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in perceived quality of life.

        <h2>Median Income VS Niche</h2>
        <img src="images/income_vs_niche.png?v=1" width="800"
             alt="Median Income vs Niche Graph">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
Neighborhoods with better Niche rankings (lower numerical values) show substantially higher median incomes. Top-ranked Manhattan neighborhoods consistently fall in the $120,000–$160,000 income range, while lower-ranked Bronx neighborhoods cluster below $50,000.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
      There is a strong relationship between median income and Niche ranking. Higher-income neighborhoods tend to receive better livability rankings, indicating that economic factors play a major role in how neighborhood quality is evaluated.

        <h2>Population vs Niche</h2>
        <img src="images/population_vs_niche.png?v=1" width="800"
             alt="Population vs Niche Graph">

        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  
       This scatterplot compares neighborhood population size with Niche’s ranking of the best neighborhoods to live in New York City. Lower-ranked (better-ranked) neighborhoods cluster around smaller populations, primarily in Manhattan. Higher-ranked (worse-ranked) neighborhoods, mostly in the Bronx, tend to serve significantly larger populations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
       There is no strong correlation between population size and neighborhood quality as measured by Niche. Highly ranked neighborhoods are not necessarily more populated; instead, larger populations are often associated with lower-ranked neighborhoods, suggesting that density alone does not determine perceived livability.
